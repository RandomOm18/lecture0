Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website serves to give users an understanding of who I am as a person.

The 'Home' page contains a welcome statement, as well as a picture of me to give users a context of what I look like.

The 'Hobby' page contains pictures of some of my origami artwork - models that I have folded based on designs I found on the Internet.

The 'Favorites' page contains my opinion on what is the best food, anime, sport, etc. These are just my opinion and my favorites.

The 'About & Contact' page is the last page on the website, containing my basic personal information and ways to contact me. Note, however, that the links attached to the buttons on this page only direct the user to the website, not my account on the website. This was done for privacy reasons.

Finally, each of the HTML pages uses a common CSS and SCSS file that were used to style this website.
